    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Locrio is one of the most classic of Dominican dishes. It was one of the first 
       dishes I learned to cook growing up. I used to prepared it at least once a week.
       The reason is that is an easy to cook recipe and super flavorful. I garantee
       that you will love it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 whole chicken cut into 10 pieces, skin off except wings and drummettes</li>
      <li>3 tbsp lemon or lime juice</li>
      <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 tbsp Goya adobo</li>
      <li>1 tsp ground oregano</li>
      <li>2 tsp minced garlic</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Mazola corn oil</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup tomato sauce or 1 tbsp tomato paste1/4 cup tomato sauce or 1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
      <li>1/3 cup Goya olives, chopped</li>
      <li>4 slices yellow onion</li>
      <li>1 packet chicken bouillon</li>
      <li>4 strands fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water for adding to marinade</li>
      <li>3 cups water for second cooking portion</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups long grain rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prep chicken. Make sure to take skin off of all chicken pieces except 
        wings and drumette. Also discard the wing tips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season chicken by adding lemon (or lime) juice, soy sauce, oregano, adobo, 
        and garlic. Stir well. You can marinade for a few hours or overnight for 
        more flavor but not necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a deep pot, over medium high heat, add corn oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sugar and watch for it to begin caramelizing. It will smoke a bit so 
        that is normal. Watch my video on this post so you can see just how caramelized 
        you can let it get. It's almost like burnt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken piece by piece while holding the lid over the pot. It may get a 
        bit splatty so just be careful.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower the heat to medium and cover for about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the meantime, add 1/4 cup water to the remaining seasoning liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn pieces over and add a bit of the seasoned liquid to the chicken and cover. 
        Continue to stir and add liquid if needed every 5 minutes until cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cooked through and water is evaporated, remove chicken to a plate, cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add tomato sauce, olives, onions, chicken bouillon and cilantro to the pot where 
        you just removed the chicken from. Give it a good stir.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 3 cups water, stir, cover, raise heat to high and wait for the water to boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once pot is boiling, add rice and stir in well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow water to evaporate while stirring the rice often.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once is almost done evaporating lower heat to simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked chicken and VERY gently stir.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover for 30 minutes. Prep any sides you'd like.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 30 minutes, stir and cover for another 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        And voila! you are done and ready to enjoy an amazing Dominican Locrio!
